1. Create a class Vehicle with Attributes: name, max_speed, and total_capacity.
Method: fare. It should calculate the price of the trip.
Formula: total_capacity * 100. Example, total_capacity = 50 => fare = 5000

2. Create classes Bus and Car that inherit Vehicle.

3. Create 3 car objects and 2 bus objects

4. Check: if car_1 is instance of Car.
if car_2 is instance of Vehicle.
if bus_1 is instance of Car.
if bus_1 is instance of Vehicle.

5. Override fare method for Bus class.
Here we need to add an extra 10% to the fare.
Formula: total_fare + 10% of total_fare.
Example, fare = 50 => total_fare = 5500

6. Add used_capacity attribute for Bus.
It means how many people are on the bus.
If used_capacity > total_capacity raise an error.

7. Write a magic method to Bus that would be triggered when len() function is called.
To figure out what magic method you should implement, take a look at the full list of magic methods:

Play around with other dunder methods

8. Create class Engine with attribute volume and method get_volume() that will return volume.

9. Inherit Engine by Car class.

10. Check what is inheritance order of the Car class
